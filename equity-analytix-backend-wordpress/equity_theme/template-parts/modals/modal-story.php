            <h2 class="modal__title subtitle-1">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">Over the years, we as traders have sampled numerous news and analytics
                trading
                services and what we’ve found was that no current solution totally worked for us and our style of
                trading. Every service we tried, disappointed us with something; others dissatisfied us in all
                respects,
                including how each and every interface displayed and delivered data. We thought, “Dagnabbit, who in
                the
                heck are designing these programs?” Well, as is generally the case with many companies—policies,
                rules,
                processes, and design are often made by someone up top, far removed from the actual use/user of the
                service.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">Knowing this and in an effort to make better use of these trading
                services, we
                thought to ourselves, “Let's share our ideas with these companies and maybe they will be receptive
                enough to include them into their programs.” So, on a handful of occasions, we provided a few of
                them
                with our recommendations and design requests. One company did implement some of our ideas, another
                said
                they would think about including our designs in a further update, while yet another wouldn’t even
                acknowledge our email.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">Frustrated with our trading needs not being met, we set out to solve some
                of
                these challenges by designing solutions to create performance and usability improvements within our
                own
                trading. Specifically, we wanted better automation and more customization so as to help us more
                easily
                and quickly navigate the sea of available financial data.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">Months later, we had multiple early stage programs in use that had proven
                significantly more helpful in our daily trading. In fact, we were so impressed and happy with our
                tools,
                we had thought about possibly leasing them to other traders. Unfortunately, after careful
                consideration,
                a bit of forward thinking, and for various reasons, we decided against that route.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">With a software release out of the question, our thoughts then turned to
                possibly creating an alternative method to share our software benefits with other traders. So, we
                looked
                at what we had, pondered over what we could further build out, and compared that against the
                aggregate
                data and trading service market. And it quickly became obvious that we could definitely do it in a
                fast,
                unique and what some may consider an improved format.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1 mb-32">Before pushing our ideas and efforts into further development, we
                toyed
                around
                with a proof-of-concept on StockTwits. We believe we did rather well, and among some of the trolls,
                a
                few appreciatives provided some user feedback that we now share on our website. Later, after more
                development, refinement, and testing of our programs, we decided to share them—along with our ideas,
                and
                opinions via a trading analytics service.
            </p>
            <h2 class="modal__title subtitle-1">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">We set out to make the complex simple by creating an easy-to-use and
                informative service focused on providing real-time, actionable intelligence filtered and curated by
                humans. Specifically, our mission was to find the best sources for real-time analytics, the ones
                worthy
                of your attention, and assess the quality and merit of that data through the lens of experienced
                traders. With actionable trading data in hand, our objective was to create and use better technology
                to
                discover and deliver data fast, faster than others, as fast as possible, and send it in a unique
                format
                where one can more easily process, consume, and then act on this data more quickly.
