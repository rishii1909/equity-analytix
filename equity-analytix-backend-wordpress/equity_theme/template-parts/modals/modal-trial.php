            <h2 class="modal__title subtitle-1">Free Trial? </h2>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">One of the biggest motivations for offering a free trial to prospective
                customers is the obvious one: It reduces the risk to the customer in order to determine if a service
                meets his or her needs. The idea is to get as many prospects as possible to try your service by
                showing
                how it can benefit them, and in turn, they get to try before they buy without any risk. All this is
                done
                with the hope of generating more sales.</p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">There’s really nothing to argue here….except, we do not provide a
                one-size-fits-all type of service—Our service is not designed for the broader investment or trading
                market. Instead, we’re a small boutique firm offering a specialized service to a very limited and
                targeted user base; event-driven/catalyst traders. Since our target market is very focused, we have
                no
                desire to sell to everyone in the “Tradersphere.” Instead, we’re more fixated with creating a narrow
                list of very happy users, than we are with registering any and every visitor to our site just for
                financial gain.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">In keeping, we, like you, may believe that if a company doesn't offer a
                free
                trial, it probably has something to hide, might be shady, even illegitimate, or their service may
                not be
                as good as they tout. Further, you may also believe that said companies may be vying for a money
                grab
                via sales to the unknowing and the unsuspecting, thereby having no real concern whether their
                service
                truly meets your needs. While these thoughts and beliefs are quite understandable, maybe even
                normal,
                they do not ring true with our firm.
            </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">We believe that while receiving a free trial is always nice, providing one
                isn’t necessarily the best marketing strategy to explain, inform and showcase one’s service.
                Instead, we
                believe that an upfront honest, detailed, and properly conveyed value proposition is all that’s
                needed
                to address and alleviate any and all fears, doubts and uncertainties as to whether our service is a
                match for any of our visitors. </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">In order to more easily help a qualified prospective client make a more
                informed and assured decision, we have chosen to be as informative and transparent as possible. We
                aim
                to achieve this openness in three ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="modal__text body-1"><span class="bold">Descriptive Service Offering</span> - Through our
                    website, we provide a clear, concise, and very detailed description of our service.
                </li>
                <li class="modal__text body-1"><span class="bold">Daily Transcript</span> - Upon request, we will
                    make
                    available a daily transcript, which provides a synopsis of all of our previous day’s
                    time-stamped
                    data alerts.
                </li>
                <li class="modal__text body-1"><span class="bold">Demo Video</span> - We present a demonstration
                    video
                    on our website which displays our data feed and all of its intricacies in action.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">With the availability of these three data points, traders can clearly
                understand and see not only how our service works, but also how it has “performed’ in the past. In
                essence, we’re giving traders the opportunity to thoroughly examine and make sense of every aspect
                of
                our service before subscribing, thereby hopefully preventing any sort of buyer's remorse. </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">We make all this information available to our potential clients in lieu of
                a
                free trial so as to create a better, more informed consumer and minimize the possibility of
                acquiring an
                unhappy one. Our hope is that our upfront, detailed, and honest approach will help guide potential
                clients in the right direction. If that direction is one in which we lose a possible subscriber, so
                be
                it. </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">Our desire is not to take on each and every indiscriminate visitor to our
                website. To the contrary, we’re here to provide a premium service to a select group of experienced,
                event-driven traders who are not only searching for a service like the one we offer, but can
                immediately
                appreciate and perceive the value in what we provide. </p>
            <p class="modal__text body-1">As we push forward, we intend to focus on building an audience through
                visitor
                self prequalification via a foundation of trust, value, honesty, and total transparency. As we
                accomplish this, we believe that our description of service will sell itself.</p>
