                            our data feeds are similar to an amalgamation of the two. Specifically, we’re an

                            Breaking news is typically broken by one source, either through traditional
                            media
                            channels or on Twitter. Subsequent news outlets, services, and individuals who
                            pick
                            up these events vary in the speed with which they pull, share, and/or
                            redistribute
                            it on Twitter. Equity Analytix has mastered the art of extracting Twitter data
                            so
                            well that we often joke, “We’ve got this Twitter game on lock.” Others have
                            agreed,
                            saying that our speed in harvesting and redistributing Twitter data is second to
                            none! Perhaps that’s because we use expensive “locate” data, we follow an
                            extensive
                            and trusted list of sources, and we “view” the data differently than most.

                            Time is a key element in day trading; seconds count! Therefore, the speed and

                            with which a trader receives and acts upon market-moving event data is paramount

                            could be the difference between making or losing money. Since time is of the
                            essence, we place our primary emphasis on the speed of data extraction, as well
                            as
                            the delivery of our alerts. In doing so, we employ proprietary notification

                            faster
                            than others and often before it breaks mainstream. In this way, we’re likely

                            the stock(s)/symbol(s) whose performance is most likely to react with the

                            You can monitor and filter a rack of noisy data streams on your own, but why
                            would
                            you want to? To do it as quickly, efficiently, and effortlessly as possible and
                            still catch as much actionable breaking data as possible, you would need access
                            to
                            the right data sources, numerous data feeds, more than two eyeballs, custom
                            software, and multiple monitors. You’d have to remain in constant focus at all
                            times
                            and avoid getting overwhelmed and confused by a mountain of data. Your eyes
                            would
                            remain glued to your trading screens scanning, reading, and filtering a non-stop
                            streaming flow of data, while you search for that next big headline or data
                            point to
                            drop.
