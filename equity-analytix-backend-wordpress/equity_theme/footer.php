                trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor.
                Therefore, you understand and acknowledge that there is a very high degree of risk involved in
                trading securities. An investor could
                potentially lose all or more than their initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be
                lost
                without jeopardizing one's financial
                security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with
                sufficient
                risk capital should consider
                trading.Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Testimonials appearing
